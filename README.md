# Node API starter by @aymxdd

This is a minimalist starter project for Node.js API using JWT + IP auth, Express, CRUD and caching.

## Project setup

Install dependencies:

`npm install` or `yarn`

Then, copy the `.env.example` file to a new `.env` file and fill in the values.

- Development mode:

    `yarn dev`

- Production mode:

    `yarn build` then `yarn start`
